# Battleship

This is my code solution for a Battleship Game project inspired by <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship">The Odin Project's curriculum</a>.

This game uses battleship.js and the console as the gameplay interface.
Future Updates include adding better user interface as well as keeping track of all attacked coordinates to not be chosen for attack again.
